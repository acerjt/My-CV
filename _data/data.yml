        tagline: "Greetings! I'm thrilled to share my journey into the realm of software technology with 
        my very first pet project — a Library Book Management System built in VB and SQL Server, dating back to 2018. 
        This project marked my initiation into the world of coding and introduced me to the fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) concept."
      - title: Game 2D Castlevania NES
        tagline: 
          A recreation of two iconic scenes from the Castlevania NES game, meticulously crafted using C++ and DirectX9. 
          This project holds a special place as one of the most demanding tasks during my time at UIT, where many students faced formidable challenges. 
          I'm proud to share that I successfully navigated this intricate project on my first attempt.
          This recreation of Castlevania NES scenes not only pushed my technical abilities but also deepened my appreciation for the complexities involved in game development. 
          It stands as a testament to overcoming challenges and mastering diverse concepts in a single, ambitious project.
          The project provided invaluable insights into the intricacies of game development, instilling knowledge 
          about optimal resource management, animation, and the importance of adhering to OOP principles.

          Developed using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), this project not only introduced me to Linux 
          but also deepened my love for this powerful operating system. 
          Through this project, I deepened my understanding of web protocols, server configurations, 
          and the intricate dance between the components of the LAMP stack. 
          It laid the groundwork for my continued exploration in the world of web development.

         this project not only deepened my understanding of Vietnamese law but also introduced me to the powerful world of ELK.
         Explored and applied advanced technologies such as ELK and NLP, 
         expanding my skill set and opening doors to new possibilities in legal analysis and data management.
